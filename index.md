## Downloads
Only a Windows build is currently available. Under the hood, the program is a Java program, so ensure that Java is installed and can be executed with the "java" command. Test that with the command "java --version". If the command does not report version 18 or above, you will need to install a newer version. You can download Java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows). The program is distributed with an MSI installer, so it is currently only available for Windows. You can download any release from [here](https://github.com/RobotLeopard86/ModDevHelper/releases). Enjoy!
