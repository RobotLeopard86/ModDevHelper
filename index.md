# Mod Development Helper  
## About  
This tool is a helper tool for creating Minecraft mods. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RobotLeopard86/ModDevHelper).  This tool is still a work in progress, and will be updated to include more features eventually. For now, it is unfinished. More progress updates to come.

## Downloads
Only a Windows build is currently available. Under the hood, the program is a Java program, but the correct Java version has been stripped down and included to run the app. Simply unzip the folder. **Make sure you unzip the file to "C:\Program Files\ModDevHelper". If you don't the program won't launch (it expects everything to be in that location).** Eventually, a proper installer will be provided.
