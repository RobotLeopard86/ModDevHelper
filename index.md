# Mod Development Helper  
## About  
This tool is a helper tool for creating Minecraft mods. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RobotLeopard86/ModDevHelper).  This tool is still a work in progress, and will be updated to include more features eventually. For now, it is unfinished. More progress updates to come.

## Downloads
Only a Windows build is currently available. Under the hood, the program is a Java program so insure that Java is installed and can be executed with the "java" command. Test that with the command "java --version". Make sure the result of that command says Java 18 somewhere, because the app was developed with JDK 18 and requires that version to run (older versions may work, but definitely not anything pre-Java 11). The program is distributed with an MSI installer. Download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7xTTCybA2Vm0nxjxmtSBSSLG5OzXJ3u/view?usp=sharing).
