## About

## Downloads
Only a Windows build is currently available. Under the hood, the program is a Java programso insure that Java is installed and can be executed with the "java" command. Test that with the command "java --version". Make sure the result of that command says Java 18 somewhere, because the app was developed with JDK 18 and requires that version to run (older versions may work, but definitely not anything pre-Java 11). Simply unzip the folder. **Make sure you unzip the file to "C:\Program Files\ModDevHelper". If you don't the program won't launch (it expects everything to be in that location).** Eventually, a proper installer will be provided.
