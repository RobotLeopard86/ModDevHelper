# Mod Development Helper (current version: 0.0.1)
This is a helper tool for creating Minecraft mods. It does not create the code of the mod for you, rather it does some of the tedious things, like adding language file entries, and creating blockstates. It only directly affects and creates JSON format files, although it may pull data from other sources.

If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork it and create a pull request. If it's good, I'm happy to merge it into the original project.

Please report any issues to the issues tab on GitHub.

# ENJOY! :)
