# Mod Development Helper (current version: alpha1)
This is a helper tool for creating Minecraft mods. It does not create the code of the mod for you, rather it does some of the tedious things, like adding language file entries, and creating blockstates. It only directly affects and creates JSON, however it will in the future create Java snippets for you to copy and paste into your code.

If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork it and create a pull request. If it's good, I'm happy to merge it into the original project.

Please report any issues to the issues tab on this page.

# ENJOY! :)
