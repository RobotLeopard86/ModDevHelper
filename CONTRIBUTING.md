# Mod Development Helper Contributors Info

## Build System
Mod Development Helper builds using Gradle with Kotlin DSL. It is highly recommended to use an IDE that supports Gradle, but that is technically optional. Gradle will automatically download any necessary OpenJFX files. The project is a standard Gradle project, but if you are unfamiliar with Gradle, it's highly recommended to run './gradlew tasks' (on Linux/macOS/Other POSIX OSes), or 'gradlew tasks' (on Windows through Command Prompt).

## Prerequisites
* An IDE that supports Gradle (recommended)
* Gradle
* Java 17+

## Tools
Gradle can be installed following the steps on the [Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/). Java can be downloaded either from the official Oracle site or from OpenJDK through a package manager (e.g. brew, apt, dnf).
